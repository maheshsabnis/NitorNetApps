# ASP.NET State Management

1. The Web Server (IIS) is Stateless so that uess configured it won't save any data in it
	- THis will save the memory utilization
2. Use State Management Explicitly to maintain the state
	- Client-Side State-Management
		- The Server is configured to save data on client (aka at browser level)
			- ViewState
				- The data will be stored in Hidden Field
					- This data will be maintained across consecutive post-back of same pase
					- If data is more, then size of page will be more
					- For Unnecessary VeiwState the page performance will be slowed down
				- THis is PAge-Specific
				- Data will be maintained for Consecutive REquests for the same page
				- Data will be lost when moved to other page
				- Each Web COntrol by default have ViewState using 'EnableViewState' property
				- The 'ViewState' is a object to set data
			- QueryString
				- POrtion of the URL after Question Mark(?)
					- e.g. http://www.MyServer.COm/page?Name=Value
					- 'Name' is the key where the Data is saved
					- 'Value' is data stored in Key
				- The data is avaiable across 2 pages
					- Sender Page define queryString to pass data to REceiver Page
					- The Sender Page Sends data to Receiver page using following code
						- Response.Redirect("Receiver.aspx?Name=Value");
					- The Receiver PAge reads data like below
						- Request.QueryString["Name"]
				- The data is visible in URL	
			- Cookies
				- THese are files to store data in Browser on CLient's MAchine
				- ANy page can access it and read data
					- Request.Cookie["Key"] = value;
	- Server-Side State Management
		- The Data is Stored on Server
			- Session
				- Variables created and hthey are avalable for each new Session
				- Each new Session will have thier own-copy of session state
				- Data is avalable across all pages till the session is live
				- Session will be stored on Web Server as follows
					- InProc (DEfault), server's own memory
					- Off
						- No Session State, generaly used by web sotes with no transations
					- StateServer
						- A Seperate process where session state is saved other than web server's process
					- SqlServer
						- Session STate is stored in SQL Server
			- Application
				- GLobal to all sessions
				- Data is shared across all sessions
